**a. Question:** How a new concurrency works and what is the main difference to old version of React rendering model?

**Answer:**

**Concurrency Framework:**

- A novel rendering concurrency model is introduced in React 18.
- It enables managing numerous tasks at once, enhancing the application's overall responsiveness.
- This is not the same as the outdated synchronous rendering model that React 17 and earlier employed.

**Principal Variations from the Previous Version:**

**1. Interruptible Rendering:** 

- The rendering of React 18 is both resumable and interruptible.
- There is additional flexibility in managing rendering processes when tasks can be stopped and resumed.

**2. Concurrent Rendering:** 

- By allowing many operations to be completed at once, rendering times can be shortened.

**3.** Automatic batching improves efficiency by automatically grouping state changes into a single re-render.

**4. Better Responsiveness:** When compared to React 17's synchronous rendering, the new model improves the UI's responsiveness.

**b. Question:** What is a <*Suspence*> component and give one example where it should be used?

** Answer:**

**1. <*Suspense*> Elements:**

- A React component called <*Suspense*> lets components wait for something before rendering.
- It works especially well with asynchronous tasks like code splitting, data fetching, and other lengthy activities.

**2.Example Application:**

**Fetching of Data:** 

- Assume you have a component that retrieves data from an API.
- You might have to manually manage loading states if <*Suspense*> isn't present.
- React will automatically display a fallback until the data is ready, or you can wrap the asynchronous process with <*Suspense*>.

**c. Question:** When you should use SSR and when not?

**Answer:**

**1. Use SSR (Server-Side Rendering) When:**

**SEO is Crucial:**

- SSR helps search engines index your content because the HTML is generated on the server and sent to the client.

**Initial Page Load Performance:**

- SSR can improve perceived performance by sending a fully rendered page to the client, reducing the time to meaningful content.

**Static Content or Infrequently Changing Content:**

- Ideal for content that doesn't change frequently, as SSR involves additional server-side rendering on each request.

**2. Avoid SSR When:**

**Highly Dynamic Pages:**

- If your pages have highly dynamic content that changes rapidly, SSR might not provide significant benefits.

**Complex Client-Side Interactivity:**

- If your application relies heavily on client-side interactivity and dynamic updates, a client-side rendering (CSR) approach may be more suitable.

**Resource Intensive:**

- SSR can be resource-intensive on the server, especially for applications with a high number of requests.

**d. Question:** What is a useTransition() hook and where it should be used?

**Answer:**

- React 18 introduces the useTransition hook to handle transitions between renders.

- It allows us to distinguish between critical and non-critical updates to prioritize essential UI changes.

- **isPending** is a boolean indicating whether a transition is ongoing.
- **startTransition** is a function used to initiate transitions.

- When **isPending** is true, it signifies that a transition is currently in progress.

- It is a function provided by the hook to start a transition by calling a callback function.

- Especially beneficial when dealing with updates that might take a significant amount of time.

- While state changes not wrapped in startTransition have higher priority, changes within the callback occur in the background.

- The callback function passed to **startTransition** must be synchronous for proper functionality.

- If a user triggers additional changes during a less critical render, it can be interrupted and discarded.

- By managing transitions and rendering priorities, it contributes to a more responsive and interactive user interface.

**e. Question:** What is a useIdhook and where it should be used?

**Answer:**

- The **useId** hook in React 18 is designed to generate unique IDs that remain stable across both the server and client sides.

- It is primarily intended for components that need unique IDs, such as those involved in UI testing sequences simulating user actions.

- While useful for generating stable IDs, it's not recommended for creating unique keys for rendering collections.

- The hook ensures that the generated IDs remain consistent, facilitating scenarios where stability is crucial.

- Useful in scenarios like UI testing where mimicking user interactions relies on consistent and stable IDs.

- Enhances the robustness of components, especially when dealing with stateful interactions that depend on stable IDs.

- It's important to note that while it provides stable IDs, it's not a replacement for rendering keys in the context of rendering collections of components.

**f. Question:** A few questions was presented. Did you find some other good new feature. Just name it in here and explain why feature is good one.

**Answer:**

**Performance Enhancement:** Automatic batching improves component state management by grouping relevant state changes into a single re-render, enhancing performance.

**Prioritized UI Changes:** Transitions, facilitated by the useTransition hook, allow distinguishing between urgent and non-urgent UI updates, prioritizing critical changes.

**Responsive UI:** The concurrent rendering engine's interruptible and cancellable nature, coupled with transitions, leads to a more responsive user interface.

**Granular Control:** Developers can use useTransition to control the priority and timing of UI updates, ensuring a smoother and more controlled user experience.

**Optimized Debouncing:** The useDeferredValue hook, similar to useTransition, aids in debouncing with a focus on optimizing performance.
